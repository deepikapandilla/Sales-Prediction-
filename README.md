Sales Prediction Using Machine Learning

Overview: 
This project predicts customer purchases to enhance business performance through personalized offers. Machine learning models like Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor were implemented, with Random Forest achieving the best accuracy (MSE: 3062.72).

Features: 
  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Insights into sales trends and patterns.  
  Models: Comparison of Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest Regressors.  
  Performance: Random Forest outperformed with the lowest MSE.  

Future Enhancements: 
- Hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy.  
- Integration of real-time data for dynamic predictions.
